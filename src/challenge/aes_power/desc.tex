      The device is an ISO/IEC 7816 compliant contact-based smart-card: it
      houses an $8$-bit Intel $8051$ processor, and is typically used in a

      as follows:

  {2}{Imagine you are tasked with attacking a device, denoted $\PARTY{D}$.
      The device is a Self Encrypting Disk (SED): the underlying disk only
      ever stores encrypted data, which is encrypted (before writing) and
      decrypted (after reading) using XTS-AES~\cite{SCALE:IEEE:1619:07}.  
      The decryption of data uses an XTS-AES key embedded in $\PARTY{D}$, 
      which is initially derived from a user-selected password $\PRI{p}$, 
      i.e., 
      $
      \PRI{\CHAL{k}}              =  f( \PRI{p } )
      $ 
      for a derivation function $f$.  Each time the SED is powered-on, the
      password is {\em re}-entered as $\PRI{p'}$ and a check whether 
      $
      \PRI{\CHAL{k}} \stackrel{?}{=} f( \PRI{p'} )
      $ 
      then enforced; if the check fails, the SED refuses all interaction.
      $\PARTY{E}$ is lucky, and gets one-time access to $\PARTY{D}$ for a
      limited period of time while it is {\em already} powered-on (meaning 
      the password check has already been performed).  Put another way, 
      $\PARTY{E}$ can interact with $\PARTY{D}$ as follows:

  }%
}%
Note that $\PARTY{E}$ supplies the power and clock signals to $\PARTY{D}$,
and can therefore measure the power consumed during each interaction: this
yields at least one sample per instruction executed due to the high sample 
rate of the oscilloscope used (relative to the clock frequency demanded by 
and supplied to $\PARTY{D}$).

This executable simulates the attack target $\PARTY{D}$.  When executed it 
reads the following input

\begin{itemize}
\IfStrEqCase{CONF(VERSION,CID)}{%
  {0}{\item $\PUB{m}$,
            a  ${1}$-block     AES  plaintext

            and            
      \item $\PUB{i}$,
            a sector address, i.e.,

      \item $\LEAK$,
            a power consumption trace
            (whose representation is explained below),

\noindent
to \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdout}, in both cases with one field per 
line.  Execution continues this way, i.e., by repeatedly reading input 
then writing output, until it is forcibly terminated (or crashes).  
Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\PARTY{D}$ uses an AES-128 implementation,
      which clearly implies $128$-bit block and cipher key lengths;
      following the notation in~\cite[Figure 5]{SCALE:FIPS:197:01}, the 
      fact that $Nb=4$ and $Nr=10$ means a $(4 \times 4)$-element state 
      matrix will be used in a total of $11$ rounds.
\item More concretely, it is an $8$-bit, memory-constrained implementation
      with the S-box held as a $\SI{256}{\byte}$ look-up table in memory. 
      In line with the goal of minimising the memory footprint, the round
      keys are not pre-computed: each encryption takes the cipher key and
      evolves it forward, step-by-step, to form successive round keys for
      use during key addition.  
\IfStrEq{CONF(VERSION,CID)}{1}{%
      However, decryption is more complicated because the round keys must 
      be used in the reverse order.  One possibility would be to store the
      last round key as well as the cipher key, and evolve this backward
      through each round key.  To avoid the increased demand on (secure,
      non-volatile) storage, $\PARTY{D}$ instead opts to first evolve the 
      cipher key forward into the last round key, {\em then} evolve this 
      backward through each round key.

\IfStrEq{CONF(VERSION,CID)}{2}{%
\item The underlying disk used by $\PARTY{D}$ has a $\SI{64}{\gibi\byte}$
      capacity and uses Advanced Format (AF) $\SI{4}{\kibi\byte}$ sectors.
      As such, each of the $16777216$ sectors contains $256$ blocks of AES 
      ciphertext: valid use of $\PARTY{D}$ therefore demands

      \begin{itemize}
      \item the block  address satisfies
            $
            0 \leq j <      256 ,
            $
            and
      \item the sector address satisfies
            $
            0 \leq i < 16777216 ,
            $
            which, since this implies only $\LSB[24](i)$ is relevant, is
            equivalent to saying $\MSB[104](i) = 0$.
      \end{itemize}
           
      \noindent
      $\PARTY{E}$ can use {\em any} $j$ and $i$ as input to $\PARTY{D}$: if 
      either is invalid, it uses a null ciphertext (i.e., $16$ zero bytes, 
      vs. a ciphertext read from the disk itself) but otherwise functions 
      as normal.
\item $\PARTY{D}$ pre-computes the $256$ possibilities of $\alpha^j$, which 
      are stored in a $\SI{4096}{\byte}$ look-up table.  As a result, it is 
      reasonable to assume AES invocations dominate the computation it will
      perform for each interaction.
}{}%
\item Each power consumption trace $\LEAK$ is a comma-separated line of the 
      form
      \[
      l, s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_{l-1}
      \]
      where
         
      \begin{itemize}
      \item $l$
            (represented as a                       decimal integer string),
            specifies the trace length, 
            and
      \item a given $s_i$ 
            (represented as a                       decimal integer string),
            specifies the $i$-th of $l$ power consumption samples, each 
            constituting an $8$-bit, unsigned decimal integer: in short, 
            this means $0 \leq s_i < 256$ for $0 \leq i < l$.

In many side-channel and fault attacks, the attacker is able to perform an 
initial profiling or calibration phase: a common rationale for doing so is 
to support selection or fine-tuning of parameters for a subsequent attack.  
With this in mind, a simulated replica $\PARTY{R}$ of the attack target is 
also provided.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a program that simulates the adversary $\PARTY{E}$ by attacking
      the simulated target, or, more specifically, that recovers the target 
      material $\PRI{\CHAL{k}}$.  
      When executed using a command of the form
      \[
      \mbox{\lstinline[language={bash}]|./attack \$\{USER\}.D|}
      \]
      the attack should be invoked on the simulated target named (not some
      hard-coded alternative).  Use \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdout} to 
      print 
      a) any intermediate output you deem relevant, followed finally by 
      b) two lines which clearly detail the target material recovered plus
         the total number of interactions with the attack target.
\item Answer the exam-style questions in 
      \lstinline[language={bash}]|${ARCHIVE}/CONF(ARCHIVE_PATH,CID)/${USER}.exam|.
